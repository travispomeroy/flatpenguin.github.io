### About

Hiya friends!  My name is Travis Pomeroy and I remember our first family computer was an IBM 5160 with an Intel 8088 processor.  
My Pops would load the word processor and I would practice typing my books out!  I wrote my first webpage at 14, static HTML on 
GeoCities *super fancy I know*, graduated with a Computer Science degree from NCSU, and now work in the FinTech industry 
as a Software Engineer for Deutsche Bank.    

Previously, I worked as a software consultant developing monitoring applications for large scale product lifecycle management tools, 
and migrated legacy mainframe applications into modern Java desktop apps and thin-clients.  I was also lucky enough to work in 
Research and Development exploring opportunities with the PIC microcontroller (way before the Raspberry PI was popular).

### Values
I value continuous learning, team work, craftsmanship, and open environments.  I had an office once, it was four walls of 
loneliness and bugs...not the kind Terminix can fix.  I thoroughly enjoy pair programming and sharing pull requests with my 
team quickly and iteratively.

### Skills
I am very proficient in Java.  I have been working with Java for over 14 years, and am an Oracle Certified Professional Java 
Developer.  Currently, I am very interested in the functional side of Java and leveraging techniques used in traditionally functional 
languages.  

I have written scripts in Bash, Ruby, and Python.  With behaviors that range from mundane file management tasks, automated testing tasks, 
custom runtime environment tasks, git hooks, CI scripts, etc.

I had heavy UI xp with Java Swing, JavaScript, GWT, AngularJS, and CSS, but all that knowledge is currently being replaced with 
microservices, Docker, containers, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Spring Boot.

I believe people who don't even write software should be using IntelliJ IDEA!  My computing life has changed monumentally twice, once when 
migrating from PC to Mac's, and once when migrating from Eclipse to IDEA.  Much like the gray hairs whose karate is untouched in Vim, I too 
love not having to use my mouse...plus a bajillion other super cool features! 

I love Agile, Kanban, Extreme Programming, or whichever flavor of development methodology allows me and my team to deliver measurable 
business outcomes while working in a collaborative and iterative environment.      

### Currently Learning

### Software Exemplars
There are too many people to list who I admire and look up to within the software industry.  But there are just a few whose 
every presentation, every published word, or every twitter post, I am compelled to digest.  They are, in no particular order 

* Robert C Martin
* Trisha Gee
* John Ferguson Smart
* Kent Beck
* Joshua Bloch
* Jessica Kerr
* Dan North
* Kevlin Henney
