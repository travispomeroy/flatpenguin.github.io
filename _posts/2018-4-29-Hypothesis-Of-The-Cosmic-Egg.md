title: Hypothesis of the Cosmic Egg
---

Welcome to my blog!  I hope you enjoy yourself while reading and watching about all the 
things I find interesting!  

This blog is mainly geared towards software development (testing, deploying, writing), book 
reviews (tech, sci-fi, soft skills), and the exploration of different software tools and 
libraries.

I will also try my best to reference other blogs and talks that I enjoy.  

Enjoy!
